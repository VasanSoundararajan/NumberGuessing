# NumberGuessing
You are required to build a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user has to guess it. The user will be given a limited number of chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game will end, and the user will win. Otherwise, the game will continue until the user runs out of chances.

# Requirements
It is a CLI-based game, so you need to use the command line to interact with the game. The game should work as follows:

When the game starts, it should display a welcome message along with the rules of the game.
The computer should randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
User should select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which will determine the number of chances they get to guess the number.
The user should be able to enter their guess.
If the user’s guess is correct, the game should display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
If the user’s guess is incorrect, the game should display a message indicating whether the number is greater or less than the user’s guess.
The game should end when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.
# Solution

Enter your Guess 10

Enter your Guess 30
The number is greater than  30
Enter your Guess 20
The number is greater than  20
Enter your Guess 15
The number is greater than  15
Enter your Guess 11
The number is less than  11
Enter your Guess 12
The number is less than  12
Enter your Guess 13
The number is less than  13
